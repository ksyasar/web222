            <p>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? How
                does responsive design relate to web technologies?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Responsive Design in the context of web development means
                creating web pages that are compatible with all devices that can connect to the
                internet and view webpages. A responsive web page will adjust the contents of
                the webpage to make itself look pleasing to the eyes and useable no matter what
                device you are using.</p>
                <br>

                <p> Let’s say for example, you are viewing a web article about
                the news before you head to work. You are reading it on your iPad while you are
                having your morning coffee. You have not been able to finish your read so you switch
                to your iPhone and continue while on your way to work. (Let’s assume you are
                using public transport to go to work. i.e. bus or subway.) Then, when you
                arrive to your desk. You finish up on the last few paragraphs before you boss
                arrives and you clock in your hours for the day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The web article you were reading was done with responsive
                web design in mind. The web page adjusted itself as you switched from your iPad
                to your iPhone to your MacBook. Each of which has a different screen size and
                aspect ratio.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through
                your research?</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have learned that the media query is a very handy and
                useful technique to identify the user agent and its capacity. As HTML and CSS
                can draw the content according to the media query result, so it is a type of
                conditional HTML formatting.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p>I was very nervous starting off the course because my
                experience with coding was not all that great. I have really struggled with my
                other coding classes (i.e. IPC144 and OOP244). I understood the concepts but
                the workshops were very difficult and because everything is online, it is very
                hard to communicate with the professors when I get stuck on a problem. As such,
                my expectations with WEB222 were also similar and I quite literally thought
                that I will not be able to pass the course because of my extremely poor coding
                skills.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>However, as it turns out, the workload of this course is
                much simpler and the professor makes his utmost effort to make sure the
                students are comfortable with the assignments and even goes as far as to show
                examples of the working code. This really helped as novices submit the more
                complicated assignments.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>I did find the fact that there is one mandatory class to
                attend a bit frustrating, as obviously, we are all very busy working and also
                living our lives along side studying, it become a little bit of a hastle. But
                in the end, I did come to enjoy attending as it gave me a certain sense of being
                in a classroom and I also managed to make a few friends from this course and we
                have become very close.</p>
                <br>
                
                
                <p>I do suggest that the in class quizzes be taken in the
                beginning before the lecture starts as some students really do have a very hard
                time being able to attend and even I, almost missed a few of the quizzes
                because of a very hectic schedule. </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>But other than this small complaint, I have had a blast
                learning from Professor Tanvir and I would suggest anyone taking WEB222 to try
                to join his class as he is a phenomenal instructor.</p>
